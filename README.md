Our project focuses on analyzing the evolving "game-changing trends" of Israeli basketball player Deni Avdija during his NBA career over the last four seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24). To provide a comprehensive analysis, we developed a dynamic dashboard that addresses the following key questions:

1. **Deni Avdija’s Performance as a “Complete” Player**  
   We aim to understand:
   - **Player Identity**: Which aspects of his game are his strengths, and where does he show weaknesses?
   - **Evolution of Playing Style**: How has his identity and style of play evolved over the seasons?
   - **Comparison with Peers**: How does his improvement trend compare with other players, specifically an Israeli player with similar data and an All-Star player in a comparable position?

2. **Shooting Performance Analysis**  
   We assess Avdija’s shooting performance throughout his NBA career to gain insights into:
   - **Shot Locations**: Where does he typically shoot from, and from which areas does he score or miss?
   - **Effective Zones**: Which areas on the court are most effective for him, i.e., where he scores with the highest percentage?
   - **Shot Types**: What types of shots are the most effective for him?
   - **Improvement Over Time**: Has his shooting performance improved across the seasons?

3. **Trends in Defensive and Offensive Play**  
   We evaluate changes in his defense and offense by:
   - **Defensive Trends**: Analyzing the evolution of his defensive play based on relevant parameters.
   - **Offensive Trends**: Assessing how his offensive game has developed over time.

### Data and Methodology  
To implement this project, we leveraged data imported using the NBA API and processed it for our analysis. The key datasets used are:
- **DA_shooting_stats**: Deni Avdija’s shooting statistics across his first four NBA seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24).
- **deni_stats**: Average statistics of Deni Avdija over these four seasons, including metrics such as shots, assists, blocks, etc.
- **lebron_stats**: Average statistics for LeBron James, considered one of the best players, over the last four NBA seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24).
- **casspi_stats**: Average statistics for Omri Casspi, a former senior Israeli NBA player, during his first four NBA seasons (2009-10 to 2012-13).
- **DA_defence_offense_df**: Game-by-game performance statistics for Deni Avdija across all 82 games in each of his first four NBA seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24).

This dashboard allows us to dynamically explore these aspects of Avdija's career and gain deeper insights into his development as a player.
